Truncated-Primes
================

Finds truncated primes up to a million and prints them

It's not perfect. It finds technically non-truncateable primes because of the way I implemented Truncate.  
Numbers with zeroes shouldn't be added, but whatever.

To be clear:  
7 is prime.  
37 is a truncateable prime because 37 and 7 are prime.  
137 is    "     "     "    because 137 and 37 and 7 are prime.  
etc.

103 gets added to my list, but shouldn't really be there since 03 is not a valid number.

i don't care to fix it though, this was just for fun
